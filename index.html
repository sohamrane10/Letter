      <h2>Dear Aditi,</h2>
      <p>
        I wanted to convey this to you. I know the past few days have been quite rough and hurtful for both of us. We’ve also had multiple fights in the past about walking out, exes, likes, ignorance, or other things. All I want to say is that these fights, though intense, show that we are growing as a couple emotionally.  
        <br><br>
        I am not running away from my flaws. I accept my mistakes, including the immaturity I showed recently. I know I have been stupid at times and didn’t listen to you. But one thing has remained constant since day one is my love for you. It grows stronger every day.  
        <br><br>
        I know my actions may have made you question our future and even Germany. I assure you that I will learn and grow. I truly love you and care for you. You’ve been so supportive, especially in my difficult times, and I appreciate it deeply. My struggles with academics, health, and injuries pushed me into a dark place, which caused my imbalance and immaturity.  
        <br><br>
        I take full responsibility for my shortcomings in communication and understanding. I want you to stop doubting us and eradicate thoughts of separation; I am certain about you, us, and our future. I will make sure you feel secure and heard. I will work hard to be worthy to become your dream husband. All I ask for is your trust, companionship, and time. I've already started to take necessary steps in the right direction.
        <br><br>
        I would change myself a thousand times just to be perfect for you. My dreams mean nothing without your blessings and your hand in mine. You’ve become a part of me. I promise to listen, grow, and love you endlessly. 💖
      </p>

        प्रत्येक श्वासात तुझं प्रेम वाढवतं.
